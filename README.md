# Appendix explanation
This appendix reports the individual average results for the algorithms proposed on paper ***Mathematical Models and Heuristic Algorithms for Pallet Building Problems with Practical Constraints*** to compare the performance among all strategies in a consistent way. The average results for the algorithms are summarized in the following tables.

# Deterministic algorithms
- EPMH
- MEPMH
- EPFULL

# Reactive GRASP-based algorithms
- GREP
- MGREP
- GREPFULL
